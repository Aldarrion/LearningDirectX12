/**
 * The ResourceStateTracker tracks the known state of a (sub)resource within a command list.
 * It is often difficult (or impossible) to know the current state of a (sub)resource if
 * it is being used in multiple command lists. For example when doing shadow mapping,
 * a depth buffer resource is being used as a depth-stencil view in a command list
 * that is generating the shadow map for a light source, but needs to be used as
 * a shader-resource view in a command list that is performing shadow mapping. If
 * the command lists are being generated in separate threads, the exact state of the 
 * resource can't be guaranteed at the moment it is used in the command list.
 * The ResourceStateTracker class is intended to be used within a command list
 * to track the state of the resource as it is known within that command list.
 *
